1. The important question is not quality of the data - there is no such thing. All data is merely data with no inherent value, it is the quality of what is done with it, and the way in which it is compiled, that is important. Thus, it is the quality of the *assertions* about the data that we have to concern ourselves with (after thinking about what data to compile and how). In the digital humanities world (thus - the world as it is now, since there can be no humanities that will not be digital) the ambiguity inherent in human relations is still there. It has just moved somewhere else. (Here we also spoke about your example of the floppy disk, and cultural practices.)

2. Medieval books: because they were relatively few in number, and because the number of people who were able to read them was relatively low, the nature of reading was different (at least in some senses) to what it was to become in the world of print, with multiple copies available of everything. But medieval books were not just for linear reading (though also for that) but as a prompt for other thoughts and as a way of organising the memory to go beyond what was written down. The physical object, then, related to a wider world and that world was often a conceptual one in the mind of the reader (can we replicate this digitally?).

3. Reading in print also has this possibility, of course. But the physical FORM of the book became fetishised, and it became the "way in which culture/knowledge/understanding" is organised. Thus, even now, we have pdfs which take the form of a book because we must have an embedded understanding of how knowledge is organised. Even millennials who have never read a physical book will use a pdf. Why? Because. The embedded nature of some cultural practices is very strong, and this is one of them. As a result, we organise our digital lives as though we were still constrained by the physical object and its linear organization.

4. Question: can we take advantage of the virtual multiple dimensions of the digital world and of digital re-imagination? (perhaps initially by mimicking the kind of medieval "book as prompt to other understanding" reading? This could be (for example) organising/annotating the text/work by ideas and concepts, as well as places and names, and syntactic information, so that reading could mimic thought. All editions would therefore marshal a range of knowledge tokens and some of these would be central to an edition, and other peripheral. But in different editions, what is peripheral in one might be central in another.

5. The modern world thinks the meaning is in the book, but the medieval and the digital sees it as being in us (or God).
